# PROJECT NAME: Learn localStorage by Building a Todo App
## Project from freeCodeCamp.org, an interactive learning web platform that provides verified certifications in various languages and libraries.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

In this TODO application, I learned how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

## CURRICULUM: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta)
